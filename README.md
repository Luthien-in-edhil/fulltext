# Full Text API
### Europeana Newspapers Fulltext API 

This project consists of 4 modules:

1. A loader module to read and parse Europeana Newspaper xml files that are the result of the newspaper OCR process. The
resulting objects are stored in a Mongo database 
2. An API that reads this data from the Mongo database and makes it available via IIIF presentation requests (JSON-LD)
3. A common module that contains the data model ((Fulltext Resources, AnnoPages and Annotations) for both the loader and API
4. The search module which is an extension to the API for supporting Fulltext search in a particular issue (Europeana CHO).

### Implementation details ###

This Fulltext API implements the functionality described in ยง3.3 & 3.4 of the Europeana IIIF API Specification.

### REQUIREMENTS ###
- Java 11 and a Mongo database
- Optionally also a Solr search engine (for search module))

### FUNCTIONALITY

## API ##

Start the server and do a request to one of the endpoints:

* Resource
`[http://{server:port}/presentation/{dataset_id}/{local_id}/{resource_id}?format={2/3}]` _(**format** defaults to 2)_

* Annotation Page 
`[http://{server:port}/presentation/{dataset_id}/{local_id}/annopage/{page_id}?format={2/3}]` _(**format** defaults to 2)_

* Annotation
`[http://{server:port}/presentation/{dataset_id}/{local_id}/anno/{annotation_id}?format={2/3}]` _(**format** defaults to 2)_

## Loader ##

For batch loading zipped EDM xml files, ensure that the batch.base.directory property is set correctly in the `loader.properties` file.
 
The loader can read a single .zip file from that directory by calling the **zipbatch** endpoint: 
`[http://{server:port}/fulltext/zipbatch?archive={archive.zip}]`.
Alternatively, it will process all the files in the specified directory by specifying **all** as archive name, 
e.g.: [http://{server:port}/fulltext/zipbatch?archive=all]


### KNOWN ISSUES
* the current version does not yet implement usage of an API key
