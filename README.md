# Full Text API
### Europeana Newspapers Fulltext API 

This project consists of 2 modules:

1. A loader module to parse Europeana Newspaper xml files that are the result of the newspaper OCR process. The relevant
 data from the xml files is retrieved and stored in a Mongo database.
2. An API that reads this data from the Mongo database and makes it available via IIIF presentation requests (JSON-LD)

Note that the loader module is dependent on the API module.


### Implementation details ###

This Fulltext API implements the functionality described in ยง3.3 & 3.4 of the Europeana IIIF API Specification.

Version history:

v.0.5
Initial release:
- split into 3 modules: API, Loader and common
- added HTTP caching
- switched to using Morphia (to enable read-only connections)
- switched to use the Stax parser for the loader
- added unit tests

v.0.4-SNAPSHOT
split into 2 modules
fix loading bugs (EA-1276, EA-1277)

v.0.3.2-SNAPSHOT
added more robust error handling
implemented Hugo's comments in EA-978

v.0.3.1-SNAPSHOT
added retrieving of FullTextResource
added separate handling of logging for batch loading

v.0.3-SNAPSHOT
(hopefully) final adjustments to Mongo schema; removed _class column generation; used Spring mongodb 
data consistently through the application (instead of Morphia); cleaning up

v.0.2.2-SNAPSHOT
Refactored .yml properties to .properties prior to deployment on Bluemix

v.0.2.1-SNAPSHOT
Added functionality to read, parse, process and save batch xml files contained within ZIP archives

v.0.2-SNAPSHOT
Added functionality to read, parse, process and save batch xml files

v.0.1.1-SNAPSHOT
Added functionality to read fulltext.properties / fulltext.user.properties

v.0.1-SNAPSHOT
This version offers the bare functionality only: there is no checking of credentials or mime-type.
It neither returns the specified HTTP status codes yet.

REQUIREMENTS
The application needs Java8 jre and a Mongo instance

### FUNCTIONALITY
* Batch loading zipped EMD xml files: ensure that the batch.base.directory property is set correctly. 
The loader can read a single .zip file from that directory by calling the **zipbatch** endpoint: 
`[http://{server:port}/presentation/zipbatch?archive={archive.zip}]`; alternatively, it will process all the files in the
specified directory by speficying **all** as archive name, e.g.: [http://{server:port}/presentation/zipbatch?archive=all]

* A JSON-LD representation of an Annotation Page can be requested like this: 
`[http://{server:port}/presentation/{dataset_id}/{local_id}/annopage/{page_id}?format={2/3}]` _(**format** defaults to 2)_

* A JSON-LD representation of an individual Annotation can be requested like this: 
`[http://{server:port}/presentation/{dataset_id}/{local_id}/anno/{annotation_id}?format={2/3}]` _(**format** defaults to 2)_


### PROPERTIES
Application name, port number, Mongodb connection settings, path elements (for rendering URL's in JSON output), etc. are 
all managed in the fulltext.properties file.
Note that any sensitive data (e.g. passwords) are omitted from this file; they can be overridden in a local 
fulltext.user.properties file in src/main/resources.

### KNOWN ISSUES
* the current version does not yet implement any form of authorisation / authentication
* the current version does not yet return the HTTP statuses as specified
* testing still needs to be set up
